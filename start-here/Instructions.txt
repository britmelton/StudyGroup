         * Then you can choose any project to go into
         
         * within each project there are summary comments specific to each test
         
         * in the test explorer it is organized by the project test suites
         * 1. mocking
         * 2. mocking-problems
         * 3. TDD
         * when you want to run only a specific projects tests then you just right click that project name and select run
         * e.g. I only want to run 'mocking-problems' tests, I go to the test explorer, right click on mocking problems and select run
         
         
         * in mocking-problems there are instructions in the summary comments of 2 of the tests for you to make a change that will show you the proof of the claims being stated
         * after you make the change, make sure to run the mocking-problems tests (do this each time)
         * verify for yourself if the change did what the comment said it would
         * e.g. "comment out line 6" you would go comment it out and then run all the tests in mocking-problems
         * you will need to go back and undo the change made before continuing to another test, in order to get the correct results
         
         
         * also in mocking-problems I have each test in its own region so you can minimize the tests you are not currently looking at
